# Hotel Booking Analysis with PySpark
Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It provides high-level APIs in different languages, including Python. Here, we will not only explore the dataset but also delve into the three sets of APIs available in Apache Spark: RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets.

## Data Used
In this notebook, we are going to explore hotel booking data from the [hotel booking demand dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). The data contains bookings "due to arrive between the 1st of July 2015 and the 31st of August 2017" for two hotels in Portugal. Both hotels are located in Portugal (southern Europe): H1 is in the resort region of Algarve, and H2 is in the city of Lisbon.

## Content
This project is divided into three parts, each focusing on one set of Spark APIs. I explored several analyses, including cancellation analysis, demand analysis, and more. I also visualized my findings using various Python visualization tools such as Seaborn and Plotly.
